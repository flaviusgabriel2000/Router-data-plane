// Router data plane

			IMPLEMENTATION

- Forwarding: 		Here, the router implements the necessary steps for forwarding,
			such as checking the checksum, decrementing the TTL, looking up
			the routing table, updating the checksum, and rewriting the addresses.

- ICMP protocol: 	To implement this part, it was necessary to go through RFC 792 to 
			respect the structure and correctly form an ICMP packet of type
			Echo/Echo Reply, Destination Unreachable and Time Exceeded. To
			troubleshoot problems encountered when forming the packet, I
			used tcpdump to obtain the traffic from an interface, writing it
			to a .pcap file, which I later analyzed with Wireshark. The creation
			and sending of the packet is carried out in the send_icmp() function.

- Incremental checksum: In order not to recalculate the checksum of a packet from zero,
			just for the reason of decrementing the TTL field, I followed the
			instructions presented in RFC 1624 and applied [Eqn. 3], namely:
				HC' = ~(~HC + ~m + m'), where HC' - new checksum
							     HC	  - old checksum
							     m	  - old value of the modified field
							     m'	  - new value of the modified field
			Thus, it is no longer necessary to call the ip_checksum() function every time.
